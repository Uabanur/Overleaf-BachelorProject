\section{Subconclusion}\label{sec:Analysis-Subconclusion}

In conclusion, the design of the program will follow the patterns Model-View-Control and Inversion of Control, as architectural and behavioural guides.

The programming paradigms used will be object-oriented (in the language C\#) for model extraction and result visualisation, and functional (in the language F\#) for custom algorithmic modules. These languages support great compatibility inside the \texttt{.Net} framework.
