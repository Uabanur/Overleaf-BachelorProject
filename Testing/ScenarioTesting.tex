\section{Scenario Testing} \label{sec:Testing-ScenarioTesting}

For scenario testing, we want to test all combinations of component interactions, for all input partitions, within a reasonable margin. The scenarios will be based on use cases, listing actions and expected outcomes for a user interacting with the program through the UI. (\cite{UML} chapter 9)

The systems tested will be the individual frames from the main window, including all branches extending from them. 

We are not only interested in testing the frames themselves, but also in verifying behaviour when switching between frames, in case of varying compositions of the internal LCI model. 

All in all, this yields a large amount of use cases, which will not be listed here, but can be seen in the appendix Section \ref{app:Appendix-UseCases}.
